# SimpleGUI-for-NordVPN

NordVPN only provides a commandline tool to control the vpn on linux. 
This is problematic for unexperienced users. For users of any experience lavel
it sucks, 'cause you have no visual confirmation on your vpn status.

This is a first basic prototype to control the nordvpn terminal-app via a GUI.

The GUI usees PySimpleGUI for now, cause its more flexible to play around.
This will be replaced once I'm comfortable with the layout and structure.
